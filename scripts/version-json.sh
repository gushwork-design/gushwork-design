# publish-sheets.sh writes this to the root of the deploy, so it lands at
# https://gushwork-design.vercel.app/version.json — public, no git, no auth, and it keeps
# working after the repo goes private. Same reasoning that already puts component-registry.json
# on that deploy: the thing that TELLS you that you are behind must not require the access that
# being behind might have cost you.
#
# GENERATED, NEVER COMMITTED. It is a pure projection of marketplace.json and
# component-registry.json, so a committed copy could only ever be a second thing to go stale.
#
# It carries a compact components map — name -> {version, breaking} — rather than making the
# hook fetch the full registries too. The reader needs one round trip and only two fields of it;
# the full registries stay where the builds already read them.
#
# The map is every surface's registry merged flat. That is safe for readers already deployed:
# check-update.sh iterates whatever names it is handed and compares versions, so names from a new
# surface simply appear in the notice. Renaming or reshaping existing keys would NOT be safe, and
# is why nothing here is namespaced by surface.
