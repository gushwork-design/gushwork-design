# There is no server and no registry of who built what, so nothing can be *pushed* to a person.
# What this does instead: every build the skills produce carries a stamp listing the components it
# used, the surface it came from, and the plugin version it used them at. This reads that stamp,
# diffs it against that surface's registry, and reports only the intersection — the components
# that build actually uses AND that have changed since.
#
# Every surface has its own registry, at exports/<surface>/component-registry.json, plus a shared
# one merged into all of them for the components that genuinely are shared: badge, the logo, the
# icon set. A stamp with no `surface` is treated as a dashboard, which every stamped build in
# existence was when the field was introduced.
#
# The skills run this automatically whenever a stamped file is in play, so the notice arrives the
# next time anyone opens the build with Claude. That is the closest thing to a notification that a
# plugin distributed as a git clone can honestly offer.
