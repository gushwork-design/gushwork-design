# Touches four places:
#   .claude-plugin/plugin.json       version   <- what `claude plugin list` shows
#   .claude-plugin/marketplace.json  version   <- the marketplace entry
#   skills/gushwork-web/SKILL.md     announce line
#   skills/gushwork-dashboard/SKILL.md

# The announce line matters most: a teammate on a stale copy sees that copy's
# own stale date, which is how drift becomes visible without anyone checking.
# Run this before you push anything people should notice.
