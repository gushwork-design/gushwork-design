# SessionStart hook — tells this machine when the design system has moved, and turns on
# auto-update if nobody ever did.
#
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A DOCUMENTED STEP
# -------------------------------------------
# Two facts made every earlier approach leak:
#
#   1. `autoUpdate` lives per-machine in known_marketplaces.json and cannot be set from a repo's
#      .claude/settings.json. So it was a manual step — and manual steps get skipped, after which
#      a teammate runs a stale version indefinitely, emitting last month's colours with full
#      confidence. No error, no warning.
#   2. Auto-update, when it IS on, refreshes at startup but only takes effect on the NEXT start.
#      So the one session that could have told you is the one that doesn't know yet.
#
# A hook that ships INSIDE the plugin arrives with the plugin. It runs whether or not anyone
# flipped a flag, and it runs at the start of the session that is about to use the stale copy.
# It also names the components that changed, which the generic "plugin updated" line cannot.
#
# HARD RULES, because this runs on every session start on someone else's machine:
#   · always exit 0 — a non-zero exit prints a hook-error notice every single session
#   · never block — every network call is time-boxed, every failure is silent
#   · say nothing when there is nothing to say
#
# Not to be confused with scripts/hooks/ — those are git hooks. This one is Claude Code's.
#
# Test it by hand:
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=. bash scripts/check-update.sh | python3 -m json.tool
#   GW_FORCE_CHECK=1 CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=. bash scripts/check-update.sh   # ignore the cache

# Overridable so the hook can be exercised against a local payload before it is deployed:
#   GW_VERSION_URL="file://$PWD/version.json" GW_FORCE_CHECK=1 CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=. \
#     bash scripts/check-update.sh

CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.claude/gushwork"
CACHE="$CACHE_DIR/update-check.json"
TTL=21600                     # 6h — the network call, not the notice, is what gets cached
KNOWN="$HOME/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json"

# Fail open, everywhere. There is deliberately no `set -e` and no ERR trap: an ERR trap fires on
# any non-zero simple command, so the first failing curl would exit before the git fallback ran.
# Every step below either guards its own failure or falls through to an explicit exit 0.
