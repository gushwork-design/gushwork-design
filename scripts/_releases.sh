# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `changelog.sh` derives releases from the commit SUBJECT — a row for every commit whose
# subject starts `vX.Y.Z`. That convention only began at v1.19.0, so the first eighteen
# releases were never listed, and **v1.20.0 (the login screen) is missing** because its
# commit was titled "Add dashboard-login-screen — …" instead. Eleven rows for
# thirty-three releases.
#
# The version field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is what `plugin update` actually
# compares. It is the ground truth for "did this ship", and a subject line is not. So a
# release here is **a commit where that field changed** — nothing else counts, and nothing
# that shipped can be left out by writing a commit message the wrong way.
#
# Records are newest-first, one per line, fields split on US (0x1f).
