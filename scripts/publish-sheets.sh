# WHAT THIS IS FOR
# ----------------
# The sheets only work if you clone the repo. Hosting them turns preview/ into
# a URL anyone at Gushwork can open, which is the distribution half of the
# mandate. It is for READING and REVIEWING — the plugin is still how you build.
#
# WHAT CHANGED (Aug 2026)
# -----------------------
# This used to deploy four loose HTML files behind a card-list index. It now
# deploys a site: a shared topbar and sidebar from web/, the Overview page
# built from the Figma, and a real Google auth gate over the internal pages.
#
#   /                       Overview            public
#   /style-guide            holding page        public
#   /downloads              holding page        public

#   /admin/review-sheet      = review-sheet     ADMIN_EMAILS only
#   /admin/catalogue         = catalogue        ADMIN_EMAILS only
#
# THE SHEETS ARE STILL NEVER EDITED. They are generated, and release-log.sh
# --check compares what is committed against what the generator produces.
# The shell tags are injected into the STAGED COPIES by scripts/_add_shell.py,
# so the repo's own files stay byte-identical to their generator output.
#
# WHY THE VERCEL MCP CANNOT DO THIS. `deploy_to_vercel` takes files inline in
# the tool call. This tree is ~2.4 MB — three font TTFs plus a 664 KB review
# sheet — so the CLI is the only path. If `vercel whoami` fails, run
# `vercel login`; never pass a token on the command line.
