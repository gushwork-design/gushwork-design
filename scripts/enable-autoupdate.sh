# ~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json and cannot be set from a repo's
# .claude/settings.json — extraKnownMarketplaces entries only carry `source`
# and `installLocation`. So each person runs this once, or an MDM writes it.
#
# Run the plugin install first; this only flips a flag on an existing entry.

From now on Claude Code refreshes the marketplace and updates the plugin at
startup, and tells you what changed. New versions land during one session and
take effect the next time you start it.
