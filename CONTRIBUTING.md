# Changing the design system

**This file is for maintainers.** If you are building a screen, you do not need it, and you do
not need Figma — everything measured is in `exports/`. Stop here.

Read on only if you are adding a component, correcting a measurement, or re-pulling tokens.

## The one rule that has cost the most

**Read the component *set*, or a variant `<symbol>` inside it. Never an instance.**

An instance read misreports type weight. Instances inside `dashboard-build` return `Inter:Bold`
for text the component set defines as `Inter:Medium` or `Inter:Semi_Bold`. This shipped a wrong
nav rail **twice** before it was understood.

How to tell them apart in `get_metadata`:

| | Is | Trust it? |
|---|---|---|
| `<symbol>` | a definition — one per variant | **yes** |
| `<instance>` | a use of a definition | no, for anything but position |

## Two checks, every time

Each of these caught a real error that eyeballing had passed.

**Compare geometry numerically.** Read Figma's `x/y/w/h` from `get_metadata` and assert against
`getBoundingClientRect()`. A screenshot comparison approved a rail that was 9px out per nav
group — three times over, and it still looked fine.

**Sample the render for colour.** `get_screenshot`, then read the pixel. Annotation text does
not carry fills, and inference is unreliable: a nav icon that obviously "should" be muted grey
is in fact the same `neutral-900` as its label. Two other examples — `kpi-card` at `Mode=light`
renders a **dark** card, and `side-panel` has no fill at all despite being drawn as a white card.

**When an annotation and the component disagree, the component wins** and the disagreement is a
finding to record. `dashboard-build`'s annotation claims `gap:8` where its own coordinates prove
0. Same rule one level up: **a structure blob is documentation, not the component** — the
`image` "typos" were only ever in the doc; the canvas keys were correct all along.

## Before you rule, confirm the silence

**A ruling fills a gap in the source. Prove the gap is there first.**

All three `Button` hover fills were ruled by hand on 7 Aug on the belief that the `State=Hover`
symbols carried no fill. **They carried them the whole time**, and all three rulings were wrong —
`neutral/850`, `neutral/35`, `neutral/50`, not the values invented for them. A day of builds
shipped slightly wrong hovers that no screenshot would show.

So: **open the symbol.** Not the parent, not a sibling, not the variant next to it — the exact one
whose value you are about to rule. If it has the value, there is nothing to rule.

The mirror case is just as important. `input/text-field`'s `State=Hover` really *is* identical to
`Default` — measured, across all 14 variants. That made "the field has no hover" a finding about
the design rather than a gap to paper over. **Silence you have verified is data.** Silence you
assumed is a guess wearing a ruling's clothes.

Every ruling lives in `DECISIONS.md` with its reasoning, and withdrawn ones stay listed there
with why. If you overturn one, overturn it there.

## Two places a value hides from you

Both cost a rebuild on 8 Aug 2026.

**The parent holds what the child cannot show you.** Every one of the login lattice's 400 cells
reports a full-strength `1px dashed neutral/800`; the `opacity: 0.3` that makes it subtle is on
the frame above them. Read the frame, then the children, then check the two agree.

**The gaps between children are not in any child.** Node CSS gives you each part; only the
coordinates give you the 40 between the header and the field group, or the 16 between the field
and its button. `get_metadata` on the parent, then do the arithmetic — and check it sums to the
parent's own height.

## Tokens come from variables, never the canvas

`foundation/tokens.css` is generated from the Figma **variables**. The canvas swatch labels have
drifted badly — all 12 Neutral hexes and 7 of 12 Primary are from a superseded palette, and 10
of 31 typography rows contradict their own variables.

Re-pull by unioning `get_variable_defs` across many component nodes on every page. The
building-blocks showcase frames are **not** a complete source: of 23 radius swatches only two
are bound, and the swatches labelled 60px and 160px are both bound to `Spacing/56`.

**Never hand-edit `tokens.css`.** If a value has no variable, that is a gap to raise in Figma,
not a line to add here.

## Never rename a Figma variant

Renaming is a breaking change for everything keyed to it. Several keys are Figma
auto-generated and load-bearing — `Property 1`, `Variant4`, `Mode3`–`Mode6` — and irregular
spacing is significant: `Outlined/ black` vs `Outlined / white`, `Size=16 px` with the space.
Copy them exactly. Document reality; don't tidy it.

`RECONCILIATION.md` holds every place the measured exports and the Master Specification
disagree, and which one each export follows. Add to it rather than silently picking a side.

## Never work inside the installed plugin

`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/gushwork` is a **read-only mirror**. The repo you edit is your own
clone. They are not the same directory and they must never both have commits.

On 8 Aug 2026 a session wrote a notice, committed it **into the mirror**, and never pushed. That
one commit made the mirror diverge from `origin/main`, so it could no longer fast-forward — and
the plugin sat frozen while a second session, reading it, correctly reported that the design
system *has no sign-in screen* and hand-built one. The component had been in `main` for hours.

The failure is silent in both directions: the stale session has no way to know it is stale beyond
the announce line, and the mirror gives no warning that it has diverged.

**If a session ever edits or commits inside the mirror, recover it:**

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/gushwork
git tag -f rescue HEAD          # keep anything unpushed, just in case
git reset --hard origin/main
claude plugin update gushwork-design@gushwork
```

Then restart Claude Code. Check with `claude plugin list` — and trust the skill's announce line
over any memory of having updated.

## Who may push

**Only Utsav pushes `main` — or an agent session with his explicit say-so for that push.**

Two things make this less obvious than it sounds, so both are written down:

**Using the plugin grants nobody write access.** `claude plugin marketplace add` clones
read-only. Installing, updating and reading the skills all work without a single write
permission, and the repo has one collaborator. A teammate cannot push a plugin version even by
accident. If someone wants a change in, they fork and open a PR, or they ask.

**GitHub cannot tell an agent apart from you.** A session running in your clone pushes with
your credentials, so any rule that lets you push lets it push. Server-side permissions cannot
express "only the human". Two things narrow the gap:

| Guard | What it stops | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Branch protection on `main`, `enforce_admins` — no force-push, no deletion | History can never be rewritten and the branch never removed | **everyone, Utsav included** |
| Ruleset *“main: pull request required (write role bypasses)”* | A direct push is rejected; changes must arrive as a reviewed PR | **everyone except the `write` role** |
| `scripts/hooks/pre-push` — `bash scripts/hooks/install.sh` | A plain `git push origin main` is refused locally. Authorise one: `GW_PUSH=1 git push origin main` | this clone |

So the release flow below works for Utsav — the `write` role bypasses the PR rule.

**Two things about that were wrong here until 1 Sep 2026, and are worth recording.** The table
said the bypass was *repository admin*, and the ruleset was named for it. `bypass_actors` was in
fact EMPTY: nobody bypassed, admins included, which is why v1.44.0 had to go to `main` as a
reviewed PR. And the transfer to design@gushwork.ai made the admin route moot anyway — a
user-owned repo has exactly one admin, its owner, so Utsav is a `write` collaborator now and
could not have been an admin bypass even if one had existed.

**The bypass is the `write` ROLE, not a person.** GitHub rulesets cannot name an individual user
on a user-owned repo, so this is the only granularity available. Today that is Utsav alone and
the effect is what was intended. The moment a second collaborator is added with write, they get
the same direct push — this rule stops being insurance at that point, and the decision has to be
revisited rather than assumed.

**The hook is a guard rail, not a boundary.** Anything that can run git in this clone can also
set `GW_PUSH=1` — that happened during the very commit that added it, when a force-push test
turned out to be an ordinary fast-forward and pushed. If you want a push to `main` to be
genuinely impossible without review **including by an agent using your token**, empty
`bypass_actors` again. That is a deliberate trade: it makes every release a PR someone approves
in the GitHub UI.

## Shipping the change

See the propagation table in [`README.md`](README.md). The short version:

1. Change Figma **and** measure it into the repo in the same sitting. Figma alone ships nothing.
2. **`bash scripts/release.sh 1.2.0 "what changed, in one line" --session "<uuid> <title>"`**

   One command, because the steps below were written down, were correct, and still got done
   wrong. v1.40.0 moved `plugin.json` and both announce lines but not `marketplace.json` —
   `stamp-release.sh` writes all of them, so it had simply not been run — and the marketplace
   served 1.39.0 while the plugin called itself 1.40.0 for ten days. Nothing failed. Nothing
   said anything.

   It stamps, makes the release commit, regenerates the logs as a **second** commit, then
   checks the three things that have each been wrong at some point: the version fields agree,
   the derived logs agree with their generator, and the new version really did become a
   changelog row. It stops at the first disagreement. `--publish` deploys as well.

   **It does not push.** `scripts/hooks/pre-push` makes a push to `main` a deliberate act on
   purpose, and a release script that pushed would route around the guard this repo installed.

   What it is doing, and what to know if you ever drive it by hand:

   - `stamp-release.sh` writes the version and today's date into both manifests and every
     skill's announce line at once.
   - **The commit subject is the summary** in both release logs.
   - The trailer is `<session-uuid> <title>` and becomes a `claude://resume/<uuid>` link in the
     `Session` column. Get the uuid from the transcript filename in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/`.

     It **must sit in the last paragraph of the message.** Git parses trailers only there, so a
     `Session:` line with a blank line between it and a following `Co-Authored-By:` is not a
     trailer at all: the column comes out blank and nothing says why. `release.sh` reads the
     trailer back after committing and refuses to go on if it did not parse.
   - `release-log.sh` regenerates **both** renderings — `CHANGELOG.md` and
     `preview/changelog-sheet.html` — from one derivation in `scripts/_releases.sh`, so they
     cannot disagree. Neither is ever edited by hand. `--check` exits non-zero if either is
     stale.
   - The log commit is **never an amend**: the logs record the release commit's sha, and
     amending changes it.

   **A release is a commit that moves the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** —
   the field `plugin update` compares. It is *not* a commit whose subject starts `vX.Y.Z`. That
   was the old rule, and because the subject convention only started at v1.19.0 it dropped 23 of
   34 releases, including **v1.20.0, the login screen**. Write the subject well anyway: a
   release with a badly-formed subject now appears in the log with a bad summary rather than not
   appearing at all.
3. **`claude plugin list`** before you push — not `claude plugin validate .`. Validate passes on
   a `plugin.json` broken badly enough that the plugin never loads; `list` is what shows you it
   actually resolved. v1.41.1 exists because of that gap.
4. Push to `main`. Anyone with `autoUpdate` on gets it at their next start.

**What the Session link is, and is not.** `Claude.app` registers a `claude://` scheme whose
`resume` route reopens a CLI session by uuid. The link therefore **only resolves on the machine
holding the transcript** — it is a pointer for the maintainer, not something a teammate can
follow. Everyone else uses the commit link.

A uuid and a chat title are opaque and safe in a public repo. **Chat content is not — never put
a transcript, an excerpt, or a quote from one in here.**

**Attribute from first-hand knowledge, not from grepping transcripts.** Forked sessions duplicate
each other's history, so a session that merely *mentions* a version reads as its author. Two
different greps produced two different, both-wrong attributions before that was noticed. If you
cannot vouch for a release, leave its cell blank.

Several chats push here. On 8 Aug 2026 two of them shipped versions within ten minutes of each
other, and a third built a component that already existed because its plugin copy was stale. The
log exists so "what changed, when, and from where" is answerable without reading git.

**Always stamp.** The announce line is how a teammate finds out they're stale without checking —
their copy reports *its own* date, not today's. If you edit a skill without stamping, that signal
silently lies. It costs one command.

You do **not** need a version bump for content to propagate — the marketplace clone *is* the
plugin, so a refresh is a `git pull` and whatever is on `main` becomes live. The version is how
people tell you what they're running, not the delivery mechanism.

5. **Announce it.** `bash scripts/release-notes.sh` prints a Slack message built from the commit
   subjects since the last tag. Trim it — it cannot know which changes people care about — then
   post it. An unannounced release only reaches the people with auto-update on.

Tag the release so the next run has a clean starting point: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push --tags`.

## Every new component goes on the review sheet — before it counts as done

`preview/review-sheet.html` renders each measured component from its measured values so Utsav can
confirm it against Figma. **A measurement that has not been rendered has not been checked.** The
export file and the sheet move together; adding one without the other is half the job.

So when you add or correct a component, element or pattern:

1. **Render it on the sheet** from the values you measured — not from the annotations, and not
   from a screenshot.
2. **File it under its Figma page and group**, because the sheet mirrors the file's own
   hierarchy and that is what makes it checkable side by side:

   ```
   01 · Core                 building-blocks · shared-components
   02 · Web                  ↳ web/ component-library      112:414
   02 · Web                  ↳ web/ pattern-library        1658:22673
   03 · Dashboard            ↳ dashboard/ component+pattern-library   1658:24112
   ```

   Inside a page, the section is the **Figma group name** — `button`, `badge`, `card`,
   `input-fields`, `fold`, `footer/footer-elements` — not a name of your own. Add a nav entry for
   any new group.
3. **Put the node id in the header** so it can be opened in Figma in one click.
4. **Say what is not rendered.** If you measured `Active` but not `Hover`, draw `Active` and state
   that the rest is unmeasured. Leave the gap visible.
5. **Tell Utsav it is there**, in the same message as the notice.

**Never render from a guess.** Two CTA errors came from exactly that — a layout inferred from
aggregate token counts, and a square count from a regex that silently dropped a column. A
plausible render is worse than an empty slot, because it gets approved. If you did not read the
component's structure, say so and leave the slot empty.

## Closing a notice

When a build hits a gap it files `notices/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` and sends a four-line Slack
block. Each item in its **"Worth a decision"** section gets one of four verdicts — **Add**,
**Replace**, **Promote**, **Revert** — and the verdict is not done until it is in Figma or in
`exports/`. Format and the full review procedure:
[`foundation/new-component-notice.md`](foundation/new-component-notice.md).

**Promote is the one people forget.** If a deviation held up across nine pages and three
viewport heights, the component is what's wrong, not the deviation.
