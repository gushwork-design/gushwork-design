# Changelog

Every released version, newest first. **Generated from git history** by
`scripts/changelog.sh` — do not edit by hand, the next release will overwrite it.
`preview/changelog-sheet.html` is the same data rendered as a sheet; both come from
`scripts/_releases.sh`, so they cannot disagree.

A release is **a commit that moved the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** —
the field `plugin update` compares. Not a commit subject: subjects are a convention that
started at v1.19.0, and deriving from them dropped 23 releases including v1.20.0.

`Session` is the chat the change came from — a `claude://resume/<uuid>` deep link that
reopens that conversation in the Claude desktop app, recorded as a `Session:` trailer on
the release commit.

**The link only resolves on the machine holding the transcript.** It is a pointer for the
maintainer, not something a teammate can follow — for everyone else the commit link is the
one that works. Entries before the trailer convention are backfilled from first-hand
knowledge only; an em dash means nobody could vouch for it.

To check what you are running: the skill announces its own version and date at the start of
every session. Trust that line over memory — it is stamped into the file, so **a stale copy
reports its own stale date.**
