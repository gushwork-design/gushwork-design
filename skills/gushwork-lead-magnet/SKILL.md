description: Builds Gushwork lead-magnet documents — the downloadable PDF asset behind an ad landing page. Checklists, prompt packs, audit worksheets, playbooks, teardowns, buyer guides. Use this whenever the deliverable is a multi-page PDF a prospect downloads in exchange for their details: "a lead magnet", "a downloadable guide", "a PDF checklist", "the gated asset for this campaign", "a worksheet for the ad". Not for the landing page itself — use gushwork-web for the lander, the hero and the form.

# Gushwork lead magnet

You are building a **downloadable document**, not a web page. It is the asset behind a paid
ad: someone clicked, gave an email, and now has a PDF open. It has to look considered on a
laptop screen, survive being printed, and end on a reason to book.

Announce at the start: **"Using the Gushwork lead-magnet skill — v1.44.0, updated 1 Sep 2026."**

That version and date are stamped into this file, so **a stale copy reports its own stale date**
rather than claiming to be current.

## Read these first

| For | Read |
|---|---|
| Every colour, radius, shadow | `foundation/tokens.css` |
| **Every standing ruling** | `DECISIONS.md` |
| Voice, casing, banned words, CTA copy | `foundation/voice.md` |
| Gushwork logo, Phosphor icons | `foundation/shared-components.md` |
| **Page shell, margins, render pipeline** | `exports/lead-magnet/document.md` |
| **The cover** — measured, Figma-exact | `exports/lead-magnet/cover.md` |
| **The closer** — measured, Figma-exact | `exports/lead-magnet/closer.md` |
| Running head, prompt rows, worksheets, score bands | `exports/lead-magnet/interior.md` |

## Start from the template. Never from a blank file.

`templates/lead-magnet/lead-magnet.html` is the base for **every** lead-magnet document. It is
a complete nine-page worked example — the "Can AI find your business?" prompt pack — and it
doubles as the component library. Copy it, keep the page types you need, delete the rest,
refill the copy.

```
cp -r templates/lead-magnet templates/<your-doc-slug>
cd templates/<your-doc-slug> && ./render.sh
```

Rendering needs Google Chrome and, on the first run, a network connection — Phosphor icons
come from the jsDelivr CDN and are then embedded as a font subset. Fonts are local.

## The three page types

| Type | Ground | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Cover** | `--gw-color-black` + blueprint grid | Logo, chip pair, headline, standfirst, hero image. Laid out at Figma coordinates in `pt` |
| **Interior** | `--gw-color-neutral-25`, white cards on top | Running head, heading, body, then components. This is where the content lives |
| **Closer** | `--gw-color-black` + blueprint grid | Headline, two paragraphs, one button. The only ask in the document |

Interiors invert the usual convention: the **page** is the neutral wash and the **cards are
white**. Anything you add must be a white surface or it vanishes into the ground.

## Guardrails

- **No footers.** The running head carries identity, section and page number. Adding a footer
  back costs ~30pt on every page and duplicates what the head already says.
- **No kicker above the heading.** Section identity lives in the running head, right-aligned:
  `Part 1 of 4 · Page 03 of 09`.
- **Page numbers are literal strings.** Add or remove a page and every head must be renumbered
  by hand. There is no generator.
- **The pages are fixed-height with `overflow:hidden`, so overflow is silent.** After any copy
  change, measure — see the check in `exports/lead-magnet/document.md`. Eyeballing has passed a
  clipped page more than once.
- **One ask, at the end.** A lead magnet earns the click by being useful first. Do not scatter
  CTAs through the interior pages.
- Numbers and outcomes lead, as everywhere else. No gradients, no emoji, no italics in display
  copy.

## When the design comes from Figma

The cover and closer are **owned by Figma frames**, not by this template. Re-fetch the node
before editing either — they are Letter-sized, so they are laid out at true Figma coordinates
in `pt` and every number in the export docs is measured, not eyeballed. Do not round them.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` applies in full: read the component set and not an instance, compare geometry
numerically, and sample the render for colour.

## Stamp every document you build — it is how its owner finds out the design moved

A lead magnet is a PDF that outlives the session that made it, and it is the artefact most likely
to still be in circulation months later behind an ad. There is no record of who built what, so
nothing can be pushed to its owner; the stamp is the substitute.

**Every document you build carries a `gushwork-build:{...}` comment in its HTML source** — the
print template, not the exported PDF — with the plugin version, the surface, and what it used:

```json
{"pluginVersion":"1.43.0","surface":"lead-magnet","createdBy":"...","createdAt":"2026-09-01",
 "registry":"https://gushwork-design.vercel.app/exports/lead-magnet/component-registry.json",
 "changelog":"https://gushwork-design.vercel.app/preview/changelog-sheet.html",
 "components":["cover","interior","closer","document"]}
```

**`surface` must read `lead-magnet`.** It selects the registry the reader checks against, and a
stamp without it is treated as a dashboard and diffed against the wrong component set entirely.

`bash scripts/check-drift.sh <file-or-dir>` reads it and reports only the components this document
uses that have since changed. Shared components — `badge`, the logo, the icon set — come from
`exports/shared/component-registry.json`, merged in automatically.

The cover and closer are owned by Figma frames, so they drift when those frames move. Bump the
matching registry entry in the same commit that re-measures them, and set `breaking: true` when an
existing document would now print wrong rather than merely dated.
